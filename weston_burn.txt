You walk through the gate.
You see a few dirty faces pop up from underneath some scattered boxes and crates.
You keep walking but you can feel the stares from all the hiding people.
You approach a rusty brown water tower that slightly resembles the color of the dirt surrounding it.
There is a man underneath it who sees you coming and puts out his cigarrete.
He says "You that guy i'm supposed to be meeting here".
You stare at him blankly and you can sense annoyance radiating from within him.
He then says "Do you want to buy some deez or not?"
You ask him what's deez.
He says "You are kidding right? Everybody and their dog knows about deez nuts."
You continue to stare.
He briefly looks around, then proceeds to ask "you a cop?"
You affirm that you are not in line with the ops.
"alright jackass, Deez is the peformance enhancing drug which makes you stronger."
"Once protien was banned by the matter baby, we had to develop a new substance"
"The matter baby found out and quickly banned the stuff, but we've been dealing illegally for a few years now".
You are kind of sick of hearing about this matter baby.
"So are you going to buy the stuff or not?" 
"It's only 100 bing-bongs".
Do you want to buy deez [yes/no/attack]
