You wake up in a dusty cave.
The cave smells righteous, and your scuffed trousers are slightly moist.
You have a gnarley headache, likely as a result from last night's brews.
Your memory of everything after talking with that cute blonde is very fuzzy.
As you get up the room seems to stabilize as you make your way towards the light at the end of the tunnel.
You hear a jingle in your pants and realize that you still have 30 bing bongs left in your pocket. Sick.
It's dark, but there is just enough light for you to make out the drawing on the wall.
It displays a colony of very thin looking people who seem to be worshipping an idle.
The text scratched in below the image says "All hail the matter baby".
You are slightly amused but also thoroughly confuzzled.
You step outside of the cave and get beamed by the sun. 
Once your eyes adjust you make out a sign that says "lumdoozle 5 spaces north".
You see the sign and think about the fact that somebody took the time to provide direction to 
the nearest town for the drunks who wake up in a dusty cave and are filled with determination.
