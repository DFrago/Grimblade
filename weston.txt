You see a towering smoke stack in the distance.
There is a horrible smell in the air.
As you approach the stack, you come across a barbed wire fence.
A man leans on the fence, and is wearing what looks like very worn out leather.
He tosses a coin into the air and catches it on the way down. 
"Are you trying to gain access to weston"?
You stare at him, still slightly unnerved by his strange looking garments.
"why, are you here? you trying to buy some deez? "
You ask what deez is.
"Why don't you just pay the 10 bing-bong entrance fee and find out?"
Pay the fee [yes/no]
