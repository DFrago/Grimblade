You have arrived at lumdoozle.
It seems like a small farming town. There are people bustling around.
There are guards at the gate, but they schlumped and are cleary not awake.
You easily pass through the gate.
You notice that there is a bronze dagger on the table next to the sleeping guards.
Do you tactically aquire the bronze dagger? [yes or no]
