Tutorial for peppegas
The game runs from a 'main window' from which commands can be issed out
While in this main menu, you can access the inventory,character screen, map, and control your movement
Enter the name of the interface that you want to go to in order to get there
You can view your character's stats and currently equipped items by entering the name of your character
Inventory will show all the items that are in your inventory
While in inventory, you can enter 'equip' or 'remove' at which point you will be prompted for the desired item
Move will allow you to move your location. W = north, s= south a=west, d = east
How many spaces you are allowed to move is dictated by how much 'speed' you have. Speed can be found in game
If you run out of speed, then you will have to fight the speedosaur. Killing it will give you 20 speed
The map will show the values of different locations. You have to move an adequate amoves of spaces
In the desired direction in order to arrive to that location
You will have to go into the movement screen once you arrive at a location in order to arrive
Locations are shown in the order of north,east,south,west
When you engage in combat with an enemy, you can access your inventory, view your character, attack, or run.
Inventory and character are accessed the same way as they are on the main menu, and 'attack' or 'run' can
be entered into the command window. When you run from a fight, you will loose bing bongs. :(
You can return to the main menu at any point by typing 'exit'
